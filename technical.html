          <article>
              <H2>☛Introduction</H2>
            <p>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.</p>
    <h2>About C Programming</h2>
        <p>Procedural Language - Instructions in a C program are executed step by step.
        Portable - You can move C programs from one platform to another, and run it without any or minimal changes.
        Speed - C programming is faster than most programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
        General Purpose - C programming can be used to develop operating systems, embedded systems, databases, and so on.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Learn C Programming?</h2>
        <P>C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.
        After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
        Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C programming.
       </P>
        <h2>How to learn C Programming?</h2>
        <p>C tutorial from Programiz - We provide step by step C tutorials, examples, and references. Get started with C.
        Official C documentation - Might be hard to follow and understand for beginners. Visit official C Programming documentation.
        Write a lot of C programming code - The only way you can learn programming is by writing a lot of code.</p>

    <section id="Keywords&Identifiers" class="main-section">
    <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-keywords-identifier" target="_blank"><header>Keywords&Identifiers</header></a>
    <h2>☛Keywords</h2>
    <p>Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler. Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier. <mark>for example:int monkey;</mark>
    </p>
    <h2>☛Identifiers</h2>
    <p>Identifier refers to name given to entities such as variables, functions, structures etc.
    
    Identifiers must be unique. They are created to give a unique name to an entity to identify it during the execution of the program.<mark>For example:monkey</mark>
    </p>
    <h2>Rules for naming identifiers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A valid identifier can have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscores.</l1>
    <li>The first letter of an identifier should be either a letter or an underscore.</li>
    <li> cannot use keywords like int, while etc. as identifiers.</li>
    <li>There is no rule on how long an identifier can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the identifier is longer than 31 characters.
    You can choose any name as an identifier if you follow the above rule, however, give meaningful names to identifiers that make sense.</li></ul>

    <h2>☛Variables</h2>
    <p>To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic representation of a memory location. <mark>For example:int playscore=95;</mar></p>
    <h2>Rules for naming a variable</h2>
        <ul><li>A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.</li>
        <li>The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.</li>
        <li>There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters.</h2>
        </li></ul>
            <h2>☛Constant</h2>
    <p>If you want to define a variable whose value cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword. This will create a constant. For example,
     <mark>for example:const double PI = 3.14;</mark></p><hr>
    
     <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-operators" target="_blank"><header>C operators</header></a> 
      <h2>☛Operators</h2> 
      <p>An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable. <mark>For example: + </mark>is an operator to perform addition.</p>
    <ul><li>
        C has a wide range of operators to perform various operations.</li></ul>
        <ol><li>Arithmatic Oprerator</li>
            <li>Logical Oprerator</li>
            <li>Relational Oprerator</li>
            <li>Conditional Oprerator</li>
            <li>Increment or Decrement Oprerator</li>
            <li>Assignment Oprerator</li></ol><hr>

    <a href=""https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-data-types" target="_blank"> <header>C Flow</header></a>
    <H2>☛Data types</H2>
    <p>In C programming, data types are declarations for variables. This determines the type and size of data associated with variables.<mark>for example:myvar;</mark></p>

      <section id="C Functions" class="main-section">
    <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-functions" target="_blank"><header>C Functions</header></a>
    <h2>☛Fuctions</h2>
    <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
    Suppose, you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve this problem:</p>
        <ul><li>create a circle function</li>
        <li>create a color function</li>
        <li>Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.</li></ul>
        <ul>Types of function:-<br>
        There are two types of function in C programming:</ul>
        <ol><li>
        Standard library functions</li>
        <li>User-defined functions</li></ol><hr>
        <main id="main-doc"></main>
      <section id="C Array" class="main-section">
    <a href=https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-arrays" target="_blank"><header>C Array</header></a>
    <h2>☛Array</h2>
    <p>An array is a variable that can store multiple values. For example, if you want to store 100 integers, you can create an array for it.<mark>for example:int data[100]</mark></p>
    <h2>How to Declare an Array</h2>
     <mark>DataType arrayName[arraySize];</mark>
     <p>Here, we declared an array, mark, of floating-point type. And its size is 5. Meaning, it can hold 5 floating-point values.
         <br>It's important to note that the size and type of an array cannot be changed once it is declared.</p>

      <section id="C Pointers" class="main-section">
    <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-pointers" target="_blank"><header>C Pointers</header></a>
    <h2>Pointers</h2>
    <p>Pointers are powerful features of C and C++ programming. Before we learn pointers, let's learn about addresses in C programming.
      </p>
      <h2>Pointer Syntax</h2>
    <p>Here is how we can declare pointers.</p>
    
    <mark>int* p;</mark>

      <section id="C String" class="main-section">
        <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-strings" target="_blank"><HEADER>C String</HEADER></a>
    <h2>String</h2>
    <p>In C programming, a string is a sequence of characters terminated with a null character \0. For example:
    <mark>char c[] = "c string";</mark>
      When the compiler encounters a sequence of characters enclosed in the double quotation marks, it appends a null character \0 at the end by default.
